The main considerations to these parts is that they would be:
- easily printable even with budget printetrs
- flexible enough to be used on a variety of gear, including both pedals (vertical knob orientation) and amps (often horizontal knob orientation).

## Servo-Pot Coupling Shaft

The first physical control problem to solve is attaching a servo to a knob's potentiometer

One option is to simply use rigid couplers like these.  What's wrong with this approach?  Nothing, if nothing goes wrong.  Otherwise, it's good to have a point of failure that's not on the servo (sithe metal-geared servos I recommend using are not likely to be the weakest link in the chain) and not on your possibly expensive and difficult to repair gear!  To solve this problem (and a few others) I've designed a simple shaft with beveled caps which can attach to the recommended servos shafts and typical CTS-style pots.

This includes an M2-spec screw to tighten around the servo or pot shaft if necessary, though adding more filament to the shaft wall is probably recommended if using standard length M2 screws.

## Servo support rails

Now that the servos can be attached to the pedal/amp pots, the servo is capable of turning the knob, but only if held in place.

## Caps for Knobs

Attaching servos to pots usually makes the most sense since there is so much variety in the types of knobs, the knobs on many pedals are very close together, and knobs may also slip on the pot which can lead to incorrect control.  On the other hand, it can be a real pain to take knobs off and to align the coupling shafts properly, especially on amplifiers.  To make this a bit easier I've also design some "semi-universal" caps which can be used to attach coupling shafts directly to the knobs of amps which use Marshall/Fender style knobs.
