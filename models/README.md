# 3D models

The main considerations to these parts is that they would be:
- easily printable even with budget printetrs
- flexible enough to be used on a variety of gear, including both pedals (vertical knob orientation) and amps (often horizontal knob orientation).

One option is to simply use rigid couplers like these.  What's wrong with this approach?  Nothing, if nothing goes wrong.  Otherwise, it's good to have a point of failure that's not on the servo (sithe metal-geared servos I recommend using are not likely to be the weakest link in the chain) and not on your possibly expensive and difficult to repair gear!  To solve this problem (and a few others) I've designed a simple shaft with beveled caps which can attach to the recommended servos shafts and typical CTS-style pots.
